Stabilized: False
Extended theory: N/A

# Simple-objects declarations
Let  be simple-objects in U1.

# Relations
Let "not" be a unary-relation in U1.
Let "==>", "or", "and" be binary-relations in U1.

# Inference rules
The following inference rules are considered valid under this theory:
Let "axiom-interpretation" be an inference-rule defined as "(A, P |- P)" in U1.
Let "modus-ponens" be an inference-rule defined as "((P3 ==> Q2), P3 |- Q2)" in U1.
Let "variable-substitution" be an inference-rule defined as "(P1, O1 |- Q1)" in U1.
