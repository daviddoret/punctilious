Let "U43" be a universe-of-discourse.

Let "T1" be a theory-elaboration-sequence in U43.

Axiom (T1.A1): Let axiom A1 "Dummy axiom for demonstration purposes" be included (postulated) in T1.

Inference rule (axiom-interpretation): Let inference-rule axiom-interpretation defined as "(A2, P1 |- P1)" be included and considered valid in T1.

Proposition (T1.P1): (r1(o1, o2) ==> r2(o3)). Proof: "Dummy axiom for demonstration purposes" is postulated by axiom (A1). (r1(o1, o2) ==> r2(o3)) is a valid formula statement interpreted from that axiom.Therefore, by the  inference rule: (A2, P1 |- P1), it follows that (r1(o1, o2) ==> r2(o3)). QED

Proposition (T1.P2): (r2(o3) ==> r1(o3, o1)). Proof: "Dummy axiom for demonstration purposes" is postulated by axiom (A1). (r2(o3) ==> r1(o3, o1)) is a valid formula statement interpreted from that axiom.Therefore, by the  inference rule: (A2, P1 |- P1), it follows that (r2(o3) ==> r1(o3, o1)). QED

Inference rule (hypothetical-syllogism): Let inference-rule hypothetical-syllogism defined as "((P3 ==> Q1), (Q1 ==> R1) |- (P3 and R1))" be included and considered valid in T1.

Proposition (T1.P3) - The proposition of interest: (r1(o1, o2) ==> r1(o3, o1)). Proof: (r1(o1, o2) ==> r2(o3)) follows from prop. (P1). (r2(o3) ==> r1(o3, o1)) follows from prop. (P2).Therefore, by the  inference rule: ((P3 ==> Q1), (Q1 ==> R1) |- (P3 and R1)), it follows that (r1(o1, o2) ==> r1(o3, o1)). QED
