# 1: Minimal logic
## 1.1: Axioms
Axiom PL1 (M0.PL1): Let axiom PL1 "A  (A  A)" be included (postulated) in M0.
Inference rule (axiom-interpretation): Let inference-rule axiom-interpretation defined as "(A, P |- P)" be included and considered valid in M0.
Proposition (M0.P1): (A ==> (A and A)). Proof: "A  (A  A)" is postulated by axiom PL1 (PL1). (A ==> (A and A)) is a propositional formula interpreted from that axiom. Therefore, by the axiom-interpretation inference rule: (A, P |- P), it follows that (A ==> (A and A)). QED
Axiom PL2 (M0.PL2): Let axiom PL2 "(A  B)  (B  A)" be included (postulated) in M0.
Proposition (M0.P2): ((A and B) ==> (B and A)). Proof: "(A  B)  (B  A)" is postulated by axiom PL2 (PL2). ((A and B) ==> (B and A)) is a propositional formula interpreted from that axiom. Therefore, by the axiom-interpretation inference rule: (A, P |- P), it follows that ((A and B) ==> (B and A)). QED
Axiom PL3 (M0.PL3): Let axiom PL3 "(A  B)  [(A  C)  (B  C)]" be included (postulated) in M0.
Proposition (M0.P3): ((A ==> B) ==> ((A and C) ==> (B and C))). Proof: "(A  B)  [(A  C)  (B  C)]" is postulated by axiom PL3 (PL3). ((A ==> B) ==> ((A and C) ==> (B and C))) is a propositional formula interpreted from that axiom. Therefore, by the axiom-interpretation inference rule: (A, P |- P), it follows that ((A ==> B) ==> ((A and C) ==> (B and C))). QED
Axiom PL4 (M0.PL4): Let axiom PL4 "[(A  B)  (B  C)]  (A  C)" be included (postulated) in M0.
Proposition (M0.P4): (((A ==> B) and (B ==> C)) ==> (A ==> C)). Proof: "[(A  B)  (B  C)]  (A  C)" is postulated by axiom PL4 (PL4). (((A ==> B) and (B ==> C)) ==> (A ==> C)) is a propositional formula interpreted from that axiom. Therefore, by the axiom-interpretation inference rule: (A, P |- P), it follows that (((A ==> B) and (B ==> C)) ==> (A ==> C)). QED
Axiom PL5 (M0.PL5): Let axiom PL5 "B  (A  B)" be included (postulated) in M0.
Proposition (M0.P5): (B ==> (A ==> B)). Proof: "B  (A  B)" is postulated by axiom PL5 (PL5). (B ==> (A ==> B)) is a propositional formula interpreted from that axiom. Therefore, by the axiom-interpretation inference rule: (A, P |- P), it follows that (B ==> (A ==> B)). QED
Axiom PL6 (M0.PL6): Let axiom PL6 "(A  (A  B))  B" be included (postulated) in M0.
Proposition (M0.P6): ((A and (A ==> B)) ==> B). Proof: "(A  (A  B))  B" is postulated by axiom PL6 (PL6). ((A and (A ==> B)) ==> B) is a propositional formula interpreted from that axiom.

Axiom PL7 (M0.PL7): Let axiom PL7 "A  (A  B)" be included (postulated) in M0.
Proposition PL7 (M0.P7): (A ==> (A or B)). Proof: "A  (A  B)" is postulated by axiom PL7 (PL7). (A ==> (A or B)) is a propositional formula interpreted from that axiom. Therefore, by the axiom-interpretation inference rule: (A, P |- P), it follows that (A ==> (A or B)). QED
Axiom PL8 (M0.PL8): Let axiom PL8 "(A  B)  (B  A)" be included (postulated) in M0.
Proposition (M0.P8): ((A or B) ==> (B or A)). Proof: "(A  B)  (B  A)" is postulated by axiom PL8 (PL8). ((A or B) ==> (B or A)) is a propositional formula interpreted from that axiom. Therefore, by the axiom-interpretation inference rule: (A, P |- P), it follows that ((A or B) ==> (B or A)). QED
Axiom PL9 (M0.PL9): Let axiom PL9 "[(A  C)  (B  C)]  [(A  B)  C]" be included (postulated) in M0.
Proposition (M0.P9): (((A ==> C) and (B ==> C)) ==> ((A or B) ==> C)). Proof: "[(A  C)  (B  C)]  [(A  B)  C]" is postulated by axiom PL9 (PL9). (((A ==> C) and (B ==> C)) ==> ((A or B) ==> C)) is a propositional formula interpreted from that axiom. Therefore, by the axiom-interpretation inference rule: (A, P |- P), it follows that (((A ==> C) and (B ==> C)) ==> ((A or B) ==> C)). QED
Axiom PL10 (M0.PL10): Let axiom PL10 "[(A  B)  (A  !B)]  !A" be included (postulated) in M0.
Proposition (M0.P10): (((A ==> B) and (A ==> not(B))) ==> not(A)). Proof: "[(A  B)  (A  !B)]  !A" is postulated by axiom PL10 (PL10). (((A ==> B) and (A ==> not(B))) ==> not(A)) is a propositional formula interpreted from that axiom. Therefore, by the axiom-interpretation inference rule: (A, P |- P), it follows that (((A ==> B) and (A ==> not(B))) ==> not(A)). QED

Therefore, by the modus-ponens inference rule: ((P3 ==> Q2), P3 |- Q2), it follows that (((p1 or p2) ==> (p2 or p1)) ==> (p1 ==> (p1 or p2))). QED
Proposition 4 (M0.P14): ((((p1 or p2) ==> (p2 or p1)) ==> (p1 ==> (p1 or p2))) ==> ((((p1 or p2) ==> (p2 or p1)) and ((p1 or p2) ==> (p2 or p1))) ==> ((p1 ==> (p1 or p2)) and ((p1 or p2) ==> (p2 or p1))))). Proof: ((A ==> B) ==> ((A and C) ==> (B and C))) follows from prop. (P3). Let A = ((𝐩₁ ∨ 𝐩₂) ⟹ (𝐩₂ ∨ 𝐩₁)), B = (𝐩₁ ⟹ (𝐩₁ ∨ 𝐩₂)), C = ((𝐩₁ ∨ 𝐩₂) ⟹ (𝐩₂ ∨ 𝐩₁)). Therefore, by the variable-substitution inference rule: (P1, O1 |- Q1), it follows that ((((p1 or p2) ==> (p2 or p1)) ==> (p1 ==> (p1 or p2))) ==> ((((p1 or p2) ==> (p2 or p1)) and ((p1 or p2) ==> (p2 or p1))) ==> ((p1 ==> (p1 or p2)) and ((p1 or p2) ==> (p2 or p1))))).

Therefore, by the modus-ponens inference rule: ((P3 ==> Q2), P3 |- Q2), it follows that ((((p1 or p2) ==> (p2 or p1)) and ((p1 or p2) ==> (p2 or p1))) ==> ((p1 ==> (p1 or p2)) and ((p1 or p2) ==> (p2 or p1)))). QED

Therefore, by the variable-substitution inference rule: (P1, O1 |- Q1), it follows that (((p1 or p2) ==> (p2 or p1)) ==> (((p1 or p2) ==> (p2 or p1)) and ((p1 or p2) ==> (p2 or p1)))). QED
Proposition 7 (M0.P17): ((p1 or p2) ==> (p2 or p1)). Proof: ((A or B) ==> (B or A)) follows from prop. (P8). Let A = 𝐩₁, B = 𝐩₂. Therefore, by the variable-substitution inference rule: (P1, O1 |- Q1), it follows that ((p1 or p2) ==> (p2 or p1)). QED

Proposition 9 (M0.P19): ((p1 ==> (p1 or p2)) and ((p1 or p2) ==> (p2 or p1))). Proof: ((((p1 or p2) ==> (p2 or p1)) and ((p1 or p2) ==> (p2 or p1))) ==> ((p1 ==> (p1 or p2)) and ((p1 or p2) ==> (p2 or p1)))) follows from prop. 5 (P15).(((p1 or p2) ==> (p2 or p1)) and ((p1 or p2) ==> (p2 or p1))) follows from prop. 8 (P18).

Proposition 10 (M0.P20): (((p1 ==> (p1 or p2)) and ((p1 or p2) ==> (p2 or p1))) ==> (p1 ==> (p2 or p1))). Proof: (((A ==> B) and (B ==> C)) ==> (A ==> C)) follows from prop. (P4).
