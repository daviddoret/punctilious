# Simple-objects declarations
Let  be simple-objects in U1.

# Relations
Let "not" be a unary-relation in U1.
Let "==>", "and", "or" be binary-relations in U1.

# Inference rules
The following inference rules are considered valid under this theory:
Let "axiom-interpretation" be an inference-rule defined as "(A, P |- P)" in U1.

# Theory elaboration sequence
# 1: Minimal logic
Axiom PL1 (M0.PL1): Let axiom PL1 "A  (A  A)" be included (postulated) in M0.
Inference rule (axiom-interpretation): Let inference-rule axiom-interpretation defined as "(A, P |- P)" be included and considered valid in M0.
Proposition (M0.P1): (A ==> (A and A)). Proof: "A  (A  A)" is postulated by axiom PL1 (PL1). (A ==> (A and A)) is a propositional formula interpreted from that axiom. Therefore, by the axiom-interpretation inference rule: (A, P |- P), it follows that (A ==> (A and A)). QED
Axiom PL2 (M0.PL2): Let axiom PL2 "(A  B)  (B  A)" be included (postulated) in M0.
Proposition (M0.P2): ((A and B) ==> (B and A)). Proof: "(A  B)  (B  A)" is postulated by axiom PL2 (PL2). ((A and B) ==> (B and A)) is a propositional formula interpreted from that axiom. Therefore, by the axiom-interpretation inference rule: (A, P |- P), it follows that ((A and B) ==> (B and A)). QED
Axiom PL3 (M0.PL3): Let axiom PL3 "(A  B)  [(A  C)  (B  C)]" be included (postulated) in M0.
Proposition (M0.P3): ((A ==> B) ==> ((A and C) ==> (B and C))). Proof: "(A  B)  [(A  C)  (B  C)]" is postulated by axiom PL3 (PL3). ((A ==> B) ==> ((A and C) ==> (B and C))) is a propositional formula interpreted from that axiom. Therefore, by the axiom-interpretation inference rule: (A, P |- P), it follows that ((A ==> B) ==> ((A and C) ==> (B and C))). QED
Axiom PL4 (M0.PL4): Let axiom PL4 "[(A  B)  (B  C)]  (A  C)" be included (postulated) in M0.
Proposition (M0.P4): (((A ==> B) and (B ==> C)) ==> (A ==> C)). Proof: "[(A  B)  (B  C)]  (A  C)" is postulated by axiom PL4 (PL4). (((A ==> B) and (B ==> C)) ==> (A ==> C)) is a propositional formula interpreted from that axiom. Therefore, by the axiom-interpretation inference rule: (A, P |- P), it follows that (((A ==> B) and (B ==> C)) ==> (A ==> C)). QED
Axiom PL5 (M0.PL5): Let axiom PL5 "B  (A  B)" be included (postulated) in M0.
Proposition (M0.P5): (B ==> (A ==> B)). Proof: "B  (A  B)" is postulated by axiom PL5 (PL5). (B ==> (A ==> B)) is a propositional formula interpreted from that axiom. Therefore, by the axiom-interpretation inference rule: (A, P |- P), it follows that (B ==> (A ==> B)). QED
Axiom PL6 (M0.PL6): Let axiom PL6 "(A  (A  B))  B" be included (postulated) in M0.
Proposition (M0.P6): ((A and (A ==> B)) ==> B). Proof: "(A  (A  B))  B" is postulated by axiom PL6 (PL6). ((A and (A ==> B)) ==> B) is a propositional formula interpreted from that axiom. Therefore, by the axiom-interpretation inference rule: (A, P |- P), it follows that ((A and (A ==> B)) ==> B). QED
Axiom PL7 (M0.PL7): Let axiom PL7 "A  (A  B)" be included (postulated) in M0.
Proposition (M0.P7): (A ==> (A or B)). Proof: "A  (A  B)" is postulated by axiom PL7 (PL7). (A ==> (A or B)) is a propositional formula interpreted from that axiom. Therefore, by the axiom-interpretation inference rule: (A, P |- P), it follows that (A ==> (A or B)). QED
Axiom PL8 (M0.PL8): Let axiom PL8 "(A  B)  (B  A)" be included (postulated) in M0.
Proposition (M0.P8): ((A or B) ==> (B or A)). Proof: "(A  B)  (B  A)" is postulated by axiom PL8 (PL8). ((A or B) ==> (B or A)) is a propositional formula interpreted from that axiom. Therefore, by the axiom-interpretation inference rule: (A, P |- P), it follows that ((A or B) ==> (B or A)). QED
Axiom PL9 (M0.PL9): Let axiom PL9 "[(A  C)  (B  C)]  [(A  B)  C]" be included (postulated) in M0.
Proposition (M0.P9): (((A ==> C) and (B ==> C)) ==> ((A or B) ==> C)). Proof: "[(A  C)  (B  C)]  [(A  B)  C]" is postulated by axiom PL9 (PL9). (((A ==> C) and (B ==> C)) ==> ((A or B) ==> C)) is a propositional formula interpreted from that axiom. Therefore, by the axiom-interpretation inference rule: (A, P |- P), it follows that (((A ==> C) and (B ==> C)) ==> ((A or B) ==> C)). QED
Axiom PL10 (M0.PL10): Let axiom PL10 "[(A  B)  (A  !B)]  !A" be included (postulated) in M0.
Proposition (M0.P10): (((A ==> B) and (A ==> not(B))) ==> not(A)). Proof: "[(A  B)  (A  !B)]  !A" is postulated by axiom PL10 (PL10). (((A ==> B) and (A ==> not(B))) ==> not(A)) is a propositional formula interpreted from that axiom. Therefore, by the axiom-interpretation inference rule: (A, P |- P), it follows that (((A ==> B) and (A ==> not(B))) ==> not(A)). QED
