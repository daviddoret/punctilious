Let "U59" be a universe-of-discourse.

Let "T1" be a theory-elaboration-sequence in U59.

Axiom (T1.A1): Let axiom A1 "Dummy axiom to establish some ground propositions." be included (postulated) in T1.

Inference rule (axiom-interpretation): Let inference-rule axiom-interpretation defined as "(A2, P1 |- P1)" be included and considered valid in T1.

Proposition (T1.P1): f1(o1, o2). Proof: "Dummy axiom to establish some ground propositions." is postulated by axiom (A1). f1(o1, o2) is a valid formula statement interpreted from that axiom.Therefore, by the  inference rule: (A2, P1 |- P1), it follows that f1(o1, o2). QED

Proposition (T1.P2): f1(o2, o3). Proof: "Dummy axiom to establish some ground propositions." is postulated by axiom (A1). f1(o2, o3) is a valid formula statement interpreted from that axiom.Therefore, by the  inference rule: (A2, P1 |- P1), it follows that f1(o2, o3). QED

Proposition (T1.P3): ((f1(x3, y3) and f1(y3, z1)) ==> not(f1(x3, z1))). Proof: "Dummy axiom to establish some ground propositions." is postulated by axiom (A1). ((f1(x3, y3) and f1(y3, z1)) ==> not(f1(x3, z1))) is a valid formula statement interpreted from that axiom.Therefore, by the  inference rule: (A2, P1 |- P1), it follows that ((f1(x3, y3) and f1(y3, z1)) ==> not(f1(x3, z1))). QED

Axiom (H1.A2): Let axiom A4 "By hypothesis, assume f1(o1, o3) is true." be included (postulated) in H1.

Inference rule (axiom-interpretation): Let inference-rule axiom-interpretation defined as "(A2, P1 |- P1)" be included and considered valid in H1.

Proposition (H1.P4): f1(o1, o3). Proof: "By hypothesis, assume f1(o1, o3) is true." is postulated by axiom (A2). f1(o1, o3) is a valid formula statement interpreted from that axiom.Therefore, by the  inference rule: (A2, P1 |- P1), it follows that f1(o1, o3). QED

Hypothesis (T1.H1) - We pose the positive hypothesis: f1(o1, o3). This hypothesis is elaborated in theory H1.

Inference rule (conjunction-introduction): Let inference-rule conjunction-introduction defined as "(P3, Q1 |- (P3 and Q1))" be included and considered valid in H1.

Proposition (H1.P5): (f1(o1, o2) and f1(o2, o3)). Proof: f1(o1, o2), of the form P3, follows from prop. (P1). f1(o2, o3), of the form Q1, follows from prop. (P2). Therefore, by the  inference rule: (P3, Q1 |- (P3 and Q1)), it follows that (f1(o1, o2) and f1(o2, o3)). QED

Inference rule (variable-substitution): Let inference-rule variable-substitution defined as "(P4, O1 |- Q2)" be included and considered valid in H1.

Proposition (H1.P6): ((f1(o1, o2) and f1(o2, o3)) ==> not(f1(o1, o3))). Proof: ((f1(x3, y3) and f1(y3, z1)) ==> not(f1(x3, z1))) follows from prop. (P3). Let x3 = o1, y3 = o2, z1 = o3.Therefore, by the  inference rule: (P4, O1 |- Q2), it follows that ((f1(o1, o2) and f1(o2, o3)) ==> not(f1(o1, o3))). QED

Inference rule (modus-ponens): Let inference-rule modus-ponens defined as "((P6 ==> Q3), P6 |- Q3)" be included and considered valid in H1.

Proposition (H1.P7): not(f1(o1, o3)). Proof: ((f1(o1, o2) and f1(o2, o3)) ==> not(f1(o1, o3))) follows from prop. (P6).(f1(o1, o2) and f1(o2, o3)) follows from prop. (P5).Therefore, by the  inference rule: ((P6 ==> Q3), P6 |- Q3), it follows that not(f1(o1, o3)). QED

Inference rule (inconsistency-introduction-1): Let inference-rule inconsistency-introduction-1 defined as "(P9, not(P9) |- Inc(T1))" be included and considered valid in T1.

Proposition (T1.P8) - Proof of the hypothesis inconsistency: Inc(H1). Proof: Let P := f1(o1, o3), which follows from prop. (P4). Let not(P) := not(f1(o1, o3)), which follows from prop. (P7). Therefore, by the  inference rule: (P9, not(P9) |- Inc(T1)), it follows that Inc(H1). QED

Inference rule (proof-by-refutation-1): Let inference-rule proof-by-refutation-1 defined as "((H1 formulate P12), Inc(H1) |- not(P12))" be included and considered valid in T1.

Proposition (T1.P9) - The proposition of interest: not(f1(o1, o3)). Proof: Let hyp. (H1) be the hypothesis f1(o1, o3). Inc(H1) follows from prop. (P8).Therefore, by the  inference rule: ((H1 formulate P12), Inc(H1) |- not(P12)), it follows that not(f1(o1, o3)). QED
