# Simple-objects declarations
Let  be simple-objects in U46.

# Relations
Let "not" be a unary-relation in U46.
Let "==>", "and", "or" be binary-relations in U46.

# Inference rules
The following inference rules are considered valid under this theory:
Let "axiom-interpretation" be an inference-rule defined as "(A, P |- P)" in U46.

# Theory elaboration sequence
# 1: Intuitionistic logic
Axiom PL11 (J0.PL1): Let axiom PL11 "!A  (A  B)" be included (postulated) in J0.
Inference rule (axiom-interpretation): Let inference-rule axiom-interpretation defined as "(A, P |- P)" be included and considered valid in J0.
Proposition (J0.P13): (not(A) ==> (A ==> B)). Proof: "!A  (A  B)" is postulated by axiom PL11 (PL1). (not(A) ==> (A ==> B)) is a propositional formula interpreted from that axiom. Therefore, by the axiom-interpretation inference rule: (A, P |- P), it follows that (not(A) ==> (A ==> B)). QED
