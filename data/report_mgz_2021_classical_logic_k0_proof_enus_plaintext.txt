# Simple-objects declarations
Let  be simple-objects in U3.

# Connectives
Let "not" be a unary-connective in U3.
Let "==>", "or", "and" be binary-connectives in U3.

# Inference rules
The following inference rules are considered valid under this theory:
Let "axiom-interpretation" be an inference-rule defined as "(A, P |- P)" in U3.

# Theory elaboration sequence
# 1: Classical logic
Axiom PL12 (K0.PL1): Let axiom PL12 "!!A  A" be included (postulated) in K0.
Inference rule (axiom-interpretation): Let inference-rule axiom-interpretation defined as "(A, P |- P)" be included and considered valid in K0.
Proposition (K0.P23): (not(not(A)) ==> A). Proof: "!!A  A" is postulated by axiom PL12 (PL1). (not(not(A)) ==> A) is a propositional formula interpreted from that axiom. Therefore, by the axiom-interpretation inference rule: (A, P |- P), it follows that (not(not(A)) ==> A). QED
