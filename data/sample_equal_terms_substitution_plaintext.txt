Let "U25" be a universe-of-discourse.

Let "T1" be a theory-elaboration-sequence in U25.

Axiom (T1.A1): Let axiom A1 "Dummy axiom for demonstration purposes" be included (postulated) in T1.

Inference rule (axiom-interpretation): Let inference-rule axiom-interpretation defined as "A |- P" be included and considered valid in T1.

Proposition (T1.P1): (r1(o1, o2) = r2(o3)). Proof: "Dummy axiom for demonstration purposes" is postulated by axiom (A1). (r1(o1, o2) = r2(o3)) is a valid formula statement interpreted from that axiom.Therefore, by the axiom-interpretation inference rule: A |- P, it follows that (r1(o1, o2) = r2(o3)). QED

Warning (warning1): By design, punctilious assures the syntactical correctness of theories, but does not perform any semantic verification. Therefore, the usage of inference-rules that interpret natural content (i.e. axiom-interpretation and definition-interpretation) is critically dependent on the correctness of the content translation performed by the theory author, from axiom or definition natural language, to formulae.

Proposition (T1.P2): r1(r1(r1(r1(o1, o2), r1(o1, o2)), o2), r2(r1(o1, o2))). Proof: "Dummy axiom for demonstration purposes" is postulated by axiom (A1). r1(r1(r1(r1(o1, o2), r1(o1, o2)), o2), r2(r1(o1, o2))) is a valid formula statement interpreted from that axiom.Therefore, by the axiom-interpretation inference rule: A |- P, it follows that r1(r1(r1(r1(o1, o2), r1(o1, o2)), o2), r2(r1(o1, o2))). QED

Inference rule (equal-terms-substitution): Let inference-rule equal-terms-substitution defined as "((P1 , (x1 = y1)) |- Q1)" be included and considered valid in T1.

Proposition (T1.P3) - The proposition of interest: r1(r1(r1(r2(o3), r2(o3)), o2), r2(r2(o3))). Proof: r1(r1(r1(r1(o1, o2), r1(o1, o2)), o2), r2(r1(o1, o2))) follows from prop. (P2). (r1(o1, o2) = r2(o3)) follows from prop. (P1).Therefore, by the equal-terms-substitution inference rule: ((P1 , (x1 = y1)) |- Q1), it follows that r1(r1(r1(r2(o3), r2(o3)), o2), r2(r2(o3))). QED
