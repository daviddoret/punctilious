Axiom (T1.A1): Let axiom A1 "Mira is a dog." be included (postulated) in T1.

Inference rule (axiom-interpretation): Let inference-rule axiom-interpretation defined as "A |- P" be included and considered valid in T1.

Proposition (T1.P1): (Mira is-a dog). Proof: "Mira is a dog." is postulated by axiom (A1). (Mira is-a dog) is a valid formula statement interpreted from that axiom.Therefore, by the axiom-interpretation inference rule: A |- P, it follows that (Mira is-a dog). QED

Warning (warning1): By design, punctilious assures the syntactical correctness of theories, but does not perform any semantic verification. Therefore, the usage of inference-rules that interpret natural content (i.e. axiom-interpretation and definition-interpretation) is critically dependent on the correctness of the content translation performed by the theory author, from axiom or definition natural language, to formulae.

Axiom (T1.A2): Let axiom A2 "If x is a dog, then x is a mammal." be included (postulated) in T1.

Proposition (T1.P2): ((x1 is-a dog) ==> (x1 is-a mammal)). Proof: "If x is a dog, then x is a mammal." is postulated by axiom (A2). ((x1 is-a dog) ==> (x1 is-a mammal)) is a valid formula statement interpreted from that axiom.Therefore, by the axiom-interpretation inference rule: A |- P, it follows that ((x1 is-a dog) ==> (x1 is-a mammal)). QED

Inference rule (variable-substitution): Let inference-rule variable-substitution defined as "(P, Phi) |- P'" be included and considered valid in T1.

Proposition (T1.P3): ((Mira is-a dog) ==> (Mira is-a mammal)). Proof: ((x1 is-a dog) ==> (x1 is-a mammal)) follows from prop. (P2). Let x1 = Mira.Therefore, by the variable-substitution inference rule: (P, Phi) |- P', it follows that ((Mira is-a dog) ==> (Mira is-a mammal)). QED

Inference rule (modus-ponens): Let inference-rule modus-ponens defined as "(((P1 ==> P1) , P1) |- Q1)" be included and considered valid in T1.

Proposition (T1.P4): (Mira is-a mammal). Proof: ((Mira is-a dog) ==> (Mira is-a mammal)) follows from prop. (P3).(Mira is-a dog) follows from prop. (P1).Therefore, by the modus-ponens inference rule: (((P1 ==> P1) , P1) |- Q1), it follows that (Mira is-a mammal). QED

Let "T1" be a theory-elaboration-sequence in U37.
