Let "U53" be a universe-of-discourse.

Let "T1" be a theory-derivation in U53.

Axiom (T1.A1): Let axiom A1 "Dummy axiom for demonstration purposes" be included (postulated) in T1.

Inference rule (axiom-interpretation): Let inference-rule axiom-interpretation defined as "(A, P |- P)" be included and considered valid in T1.

Proposition (T1.P1): r1(o1, o2). Proof: "Dummy axiom for demonstration purposes" is postulated by axiom (A1). r1(o1, o2) is a propositional formula interpreted from that axiom. Therefore, by the axiom-interpretation inference rule: (A, P |- P), it follows that r1(o1, o2). QED

Proposition (T1.P2): not(r1(o1, o2)). Proof: "Dummy axiom for demonstration purposes" is postulated by axiom (A1). not(r1(o1, o2)) is a propositional formula interpreted from that axiom. Therefore, by the axiom-interpretation inference rule: (A, P |- P), it follows that not(r1(o1, o2)). QED

Inference rule (inconsistency-introduction-1): Let inference-rule inconsistency-introduction-1 defined as "(P1, not(P1) |- Inc(T1))" be included and considered valid in T2.

Proposition (T2.P3) - The proposition of interest: Inc(T1). Proof: Let P := r1(o1, o2), which follows from prop. (P1). Let not(P) := not(r1(o1, o2)), which follows from prop. (P2).  Therefore, by the inconsistency-introduction-1 inference rule: (P1, not(P1) |- Inc(T1)), it follows that Inc(T1). QED
