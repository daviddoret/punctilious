Let "U7" be a universe-of-discourse.

Let "T1" be a theory-elaboration-sequence in U7.

Axiom (T1.A1): Let axiom A1 "Dummy axiom for demonstration purposes" be included (postulated) in T1.

Inference rule (axiom-interpretation): Let inference-rule axiom-interpretation defined as "(A2, P1 |- P1)" be included and considered valid in T1.

Proposition (T1.P1): (r1(o1, o2) <==> r2(o3)). Proof: "Dummy axiom for demonstration purposes" is postulated by axiom (A1). (r1(o1, o2) <==> r2(o3)) is a valid formula statement interpreted from that axiom.Therefore, by the  inference rule: (A2, P1 |- P1), it follows that (r1(o1, o2) <==> r2(o3)). QED

Inference rule (biconditional-elimination-2): Let inference-rule biconditional-elimination-2 defined as "((P3 <==> Q1) |- (Q1 ==> P3))" be included and considered valid in T1.

Proposition (T1.P2) - The proposition of interest: (r2(o3) ==> r1(o1, o2)). Proof: (r1(o1, o2) <==> r2(o3)), of the form (P3 <==> Q1), follows from prop. (P1). Therefore, by the  inference rule: ((P3 <==> Q1) |- (Q1 ==> P3)), it follows that (r2(o3) ==> r1(o1, o2)). QED
