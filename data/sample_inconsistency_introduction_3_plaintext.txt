Let "U57" be a universe-of-discourse.

Let "T1" be a theory-derivation in U57.

Axiom (T1.A1): Let axiom A1 "Dummy axiom for demonstration purposes" be included (postulated) in T1.

Inference rule (axiom-interpretation): Let inference-rule axiom-interpretation defined as "(A, P |- P)" be included and considered valid in T1.

Proposition (T1.P1): (o1 neq o1). Proof: "Dummy axiom for demonstration purposes" is postulated by axiom (A1). (o1 neq o1) is a propositional formula interpreted from that axiom. Therefore, by the axiom-interpretation inference rule: (A, P |- P), it follows that (o1 neq o1). QED

Let "T2" be a theory-derivation in U57.

Inference rule (inconsistency-introduction-3): Let inference-rule inconsistency-introduction-3 defined as "((P1 neq P1) |- Inc(T1))" be included and considered valid in T2.

Proposition (T2.P2) - The proposition of interest: Inc(T1). Proof: Let (P neq P) := (o1 neq o1), which follows from prop. (P1).  Therefore, by the inconsistency-introduction-3 inference rule: ((P1 neq P1) |- Inc(T1)), it follows that Inc(T1). QED
