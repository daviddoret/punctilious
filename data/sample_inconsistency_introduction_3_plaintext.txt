Let "U37" be a universe-of-discourse.

Let "T1" be a theory-elaboration-sequence in U37.

Axiom (T1.A1): Let axiom A1 "Dummy axiom for demonstration purposes" be included (postulated) in T1.

Inference rule (axiom-interpretation): Let inference-rule axiom-interpretation defined as "A |- P" be included and considered valid in T1.

Proposition (T1.P1): (o1 neq o1). Proof: "Dummy axiom for demonstration purposes" is postulated by axiom (A1). (o1 neq o1) is a valid formula statement interpreted from that axiom.Therefore, by the axiom-interpretation inference rule: A |- P, it follows that (o1 neq o1). QED

Warning (warning1): By design, punctilious assures the syntactical correctness of theories, but does not perform any semantic verification. Therefore, the usage of inference-rules that interpret natural content (i.e. axiom-interpretation and definition-interpretation) is critically dependent on the correctness of the content translation performed by the theory author, from axiom or definition natural language, to formulae.

Let "T2" be a theory-elaboration-sequence in U37.

Inference rule (inconsistency-introduction-3): Let inference-rule inconsistency-introduction-3 defined as "(P neq P) |- Inc(T)" be included and considered valid in T2.

Proposition (T2.P2) - The proposition of interest: Inc(T1). Proof: Let (P neq P) := (o1 neq o1), which follows from prop. (P1). Therefore, by the inconsistency-introduction-3 inference rule: (P neq P) |- Inc(T), it follows that Inc(T1). QED
