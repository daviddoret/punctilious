Let "U11" be a universe-of-discourse.

Let "T1" be a theory-derivation in U11.

Axiom (T1.A1): Let axiom A1 "Dummy axiom for demonstration purposes" be included (postulated) in T1.

Inference rule (axiom-interpretation): Let inference-rule axiom-interpretation defined as "(A, P |- P)" be included and considered valid in T1.

Proposition (T1.P1): (r1(o1, o2) and r2(o3)). Proof: "Dummy axiom for demonstration purposes" is postulated by axiom (A1). (r1(o1, o2) and r2(o3)) is a propositional formula interpreted from that axiom. Therefore, by the axiom-interpretation inference rule: (A, P |- P), it follows that (r1(o1, o2) and r2(o3)). QED

Inference rule (conjunction-elimination-1): Let inference-rule conjunction-elimination-1 defined as "((P1 and Q1) |- P1)" be included and considered valid in T1.

Proposition (T1.P2) - The proposition of interest: r1(o1, o2). Proof: (r1(o1, o2) and r2(o3)), of the form (P1 and Q1), follows from prop. (P1).  Therefore, by the conjunction-elimination-1 inference rule: ((P1 and Q1) |- P1), it follows that r1(o1, o2). QED
