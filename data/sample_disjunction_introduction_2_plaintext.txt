Let "U25" be a universe-of-discourse.

Let "T1" be a theory-derivation in U25.

Axiom (T1.A1): Let axiom A1 "Dummy axiom for demonstration purposes" be included (postulated) in T1.

Inference rule (axiom-interpretation): Let inference-rule axiom-interpretation defined as "(A, P |- P)" be included and considered valid in T1.

Proposition (T1.P1): r1(o1, o2). Proof: "Dummy axiom for demonstration purposes" is postulated by axiom (A1). r1(o1, o2) is a propositional formula interpreted from that axiom. Therefore, by the axiom-interpretation inference rule: (A, P |- P), it follows that r1(o1, o2). QED

Inference rule (disjunction-introduction-2): Let inference-rule disjunction-introduction-2 defined as "(P1 |- (P1 or Q1))" be included and considered valid in T1.

Proposition (T1.P2) - The proposition of interest: (r1(o1, o2) or r2(o3)). Proof: r1(o1, o2), of the form P1, follows from prop. (P1). r2(o3), of the form Q1, is given.  Therefore, by the disjunction-introduction-2 inference rule: (P1 |- (P1 or Q1)), it follows that (r1(o1, o2) or r2(o3)). QED
