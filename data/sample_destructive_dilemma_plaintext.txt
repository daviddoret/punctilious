Let "U21" be a universe-of-discourse.

Let "T1" be a theory-derivation in U21.

Axiom (T1.A1): Let axiom A1 "Dummy axiom for demonstration purposes" be included (postulated) in T1.

Inference rule (axiom-interpretation): Let inference-rule axiom-interpretation defined as "(A, P |- P)" be included and considered valid in T1.

Proposition (T1.P1): (o1 ==> o2). Proof: "Dummy axiom for demonstration purposes" is postulated by axiom (A1). (o1 ==> o2) is a propositional formula interpreted from that axiom. Therefore, by the axiom-interpretation inference rule: (A, P |- P), it follows that (o1 ==> o2). QED

Proposition (T1.P2): (o3 ==> o4). Proof: "Dummy axiom for demonstration purposes" is postulated by axiom (A1). (o3 ==> o4) is a propositional formula interpreted from that axiom. Therefore, by the axiom-interpretation inference rule: (A, P |- P), it follows that (o3 ==> o4). QED

Proposition (T1.P3): (not(o2) or not(o4)). Proof: "Dummy axiom for demonstration purposes" is postulated by axiom (A1). (not(o2) or not(o4)) is a propositional formula interpreted from that axiom. Therefore, by the axiom-interpretation inference rule: (A, P |- P), it follows that (not(o2) or not(o4)). QED

Inference rule (destructive-dilemma): Let inference-rule destructive-dilemma defined as "((P1 ==> Q1), (R1 ==> S1), (P1 or R1) |- (Q1 or S1))" be included and considered valid in T1.

Proposition (T1.P4) - The proposition of interest: (not(o1) or not(o3)). Proof: (o1 ==> o2), of the form (P1 ==> Q1), follows from prop. (P1). (o3 ==> o4), of the form (R1 ==> S1), follows from prop. (P2). (not(o2) or not(o4)), of the form (P1 or R1), follows from prop. (P3).  Therefore, by the destructive-dilemma inference rule: ((P1 ==> Q1), (R1 ==> S1), (P1 or R1) |- (Q1 or S1)), it follows that (not(o1) or not(o3)). QED
