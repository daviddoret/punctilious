Let "U47" be a universe-of-discourse.

Let "T1" be a theory-elaboration-sequence in U47.

Axiom (T1.A1): Let axiom A1 "Dummy axiom for demonstration purposes" be included (postulated) in T1.

Inference rule (axiom-interpretation): Let inference-rule axiom-interpretation defined as "(A2, P1 |- P1)" be included and considered valid in T1.

Proposition (T1.P1): (o1 = o2). Proof: "Dummy axiom for demonstration purposes" is postulated by axiom (A1). (o1 = o2) is a valid formula statement interpreted from that axiom.Therefore, by the  inference rule: (A2, P1 |- P1), it follows that (o1 = o2). QED

Proposition (T1.P2): (o1 neq o2). Proof: "Dummy axiom for demonstration purposes" is postulated by axiom (A1). (o1 neq o2) is a valid formula statement interpreted from that axiom.Therefore, by the  inference rule: (A2, P1 |- P1), it follows that (o1 neq o2). QED

Let "T2" be a theory-elaboration-sequence in U47.

Inference rule (inconsistency-introduction-2): Let inference-rule inconsistency-introduction-2 defined as "((P3 = Q1), (P3 neq Q1) |- Inc(T1))" be included and considered valid in T2.

Proposition (T2.P3) - The proposition of interest: Inc(T1). Proof: Let (P = Q) := (o1 = o2) follows from prop. (P1). Let (P neq Q)) := (o1 neq o2) follows from prop. (P2). Therefore, by the  inference rule: ((P3 = Q1), (P3 neq Q1) |- Inc(T1)), it follows that Inc(T1). QED
