Let "U17" be a universe-of-discourse.

Let "T1" be a theory-derivation in U17.

Axiom (T1.A1): Let axiom A1 "Dummy axiom for demonstration purposes" be included (postulated) in T1.

Inference rule (axiom-interpretation): Let inference-rule axiom-interpretation defined as "(A, P |- P)" be included and considered valid in T1.

Proposition (T1.P1): (o1 ==> o2). Proof: "Dummy axiom for demonstration purposes" is postulated by axiom (A1). (o1 ==> o2) is a propositional formula interpreted from that axiom. Therefore, by the axiom-interpretation inference rule: (A, P |- P), it follows that (o1 ==> o2). QED

Proposition (T1.P2): (o3 ==> o4). Proof: "Dummy axiom for demonstration purposes" is postulated by axiom (A1). (o3 ==> o4) is a propositional formula interpreted from that axiom. Therefore, by the axiom-interpretation inference rule: (A, P |- P), it follows that (o3 ==> o4). QED

Proposition (T1.P3): (o1 or o3). Proof: "Dummy axiom for demonstration purposes" is postulated by axiom (A1). (o1 or o3) is a propositional formula interpreted from that axiom. Therefore, by the axiom-interpretation inference rule: (A, P |- P), it follows that (o1 or o3). QED

Inference rule (constructive-dilemma): Let inference-rule constructive-dilemma defined as "((P1 ==> Q1), (R1 ==> S1), (P1 or R1) |- (Q1 or S1))" be included and considered valid in T1.

Proposition (T1.P4) - The proposition of interest: (o2 or o4). Proof: (o1 ==> o2), of the form (P1 ==> Q1), follows from prop. (P1). (o3 ==> o4), of the form (R1 ==> S1), follows from prop. (P2). (o1 or o3), of the form (P1 or R1), follows from prop. (P3).  Therefore, by the constructive-dilemma inference rule: ((P1 ==> Q1), (R1 ==> S1), (P1 or R1) |- (Q1 or S1)), it follows that (o2 or o4).
