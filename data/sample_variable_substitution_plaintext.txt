Let "U77" be a universe-of-discourse.

Let "T1" be a theory-derivation in U77.

Axiom (T1.A): Let axiom A "Dummy axiom to establish some ground propositions." be included (postulated) in T1.

Inference rule (axiom-interpretation): Let inference-rule axiom-interpretation defined as "(A, P |- P)" be included and considered valid in T1.

Proposition (T1.P): f(o, o). Proof: "Dummy axiom to establish some ground propositions." is postulated by axiom (A). f(o, o) is a propositional formula interpreted from that axiom. Therefore, by the axiom-interpretation inference rule: (A, P |- P), it follows that f(o, o). QED

Proposition (T1.P): (f(x, y) ==> f(y, x)). Proof: "Dummy axiom to establish some ground propositions." is postulated by axiom (A). (f(x, y) ==> f(y, x)) is a propositional formula interpreted from that axiom. Therefore, by the axiom-interpretation inference rule: (A, P |- P), it follows that (f(x, y) ==> f(y, x)). QED

Inference rule (variable-substitution): Let inference-rule variable-substitution defined as "(P, O |- Q)" be included and considered valid in T1.

Proposition (T1.P): (f(o, o) ==> f(o, o)). Proof: (f(x, y) ==> f(y, x)) follows from prop. (P). Let x = o, y = o. Therefore, by the variable-substitution inference rule: (P, O |- Q), it follows that (f(o, o) ==> f(o, o)). QED
