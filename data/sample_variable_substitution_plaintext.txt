Let "U73" be a universe-of-discourse.

Let "T1" be a theory-derivation in U73.

Axiom (T1.A1): Let axiom A1 "Dummy axiom to establish some ground propositions." be included (postulated) in T1.

Inference rule (axiom-interpretation): Let inference-rule axiom-interpretation defined as "(A2, P1 |- P1)" be included and considered valid in T1.

Proposition (T1.P1): f1(o1, o2). Proof: "Dummy axiom to establish some ground propositions." is postulated by axiom (A1). f1(o1, o2) is a valid formula statement interpreted from that axiom.Therefore, by the  inference rule: (A2, P1 |- P1), it follows that f1(o1, o2). QED

Proposition (T1.P2): (f1(x3, y3) ==> f1(y3, x3)). Proof: "Dummy axiom to establish some ground propositions." is postulated by axiom (A1). (f1(x3, y3) ==> f1(y3, x3)) is a valid formula statement interpreted from that axiom.Therefore, by the  inference rule: (A2, P1 |- P1), it follows that (f1(x3, y3) ==> f1(y3, x3)). QED

Inference rule (variable-substitution): Let inference-rule variable-substitution defined as "(P3, O1 |- Q1)" be included and considered valid in T1.

Proposition (T1.P3): (f1(o1, o2) ==> f1(o2, o1)). Proof: (f1(x3, y3) ==> f1(y3, x3)) follows from prop. (P2). Let x3 = o1, y3 = o2.Therefore, by the  inference rule: (P3, O1 |- Q1), it follows that (f1(o1, o2) ==> f1(o2, o1)). QED
