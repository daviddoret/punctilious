Let "U59" be a universe-of-discourse.

Let "T1" be a theory-elaboration-sequence in U59.

Axiom (T1.A1): Let axiom A1 "Dummy axiom to establish some ground propositions." be included (postulated) in T1.

Inference rule (axiom-interpretation): Let inference-rule axiom-interpretation defined as "A |- P" be included and considered valid in T1.

Proposition (T1.P1): f1(o1, o2). Proof: "Dummy axiom to establish some ground propositions." is postulated by axiom (A1). f1(o1, o2) is a valid formula statement interpreted from that axiom.Therefore, by the axiom-interpretation inference rule: A |- P, it follows that f1(o1, o2). QED

Warning (warning1): By design, punctilious assures the syntactical correctness of theories, but does not perform any semantic verification. Therefore, the usage of inference-rules that interpret natural content (i.e. axiom-interpretation and definition-interpretation) is critically dependent on the correctness of the content translation performed by the theory author, from axiom or definition natural language, to formulae.

Proposition (T1.P2): (f1(x1, y1) ==> f1(y1, x1)). Proof: "Dummy axiom to establish some ground propositions." is postulated by axiom (A1). (f1(x1, y1) ==> f1(y1, x1)) is a valid formula statement interpreted from that axiom.Therefore, by the axiom-interpretation inference rule: A |- P, it follows that (f1(x1, y1) ==> f1(y1, x1)). QED

Inference rule (variable-substitution): Let inference-rule variable-substitution defined as "(P, Phi) |- P'" be included and considered valid in T1.

Proposition (T1.P3): (f1(o1, o2) ==> f1(o2, o1)). Proof: (f1(x1, y1) ==> f1(y1, x1)) follows from prop. (P2). Let x1 = o1, y1 = o2.Therefore, by the variable-substitution inference rule: (P, Phi) |- P', it follows that (f1(o1, o2) ==> f1(o2, o1)). QED
