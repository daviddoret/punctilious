Let "U59" be a universe-of-discourse.

Let "T1" be a theory-derivation in U59.

Axiom (T1.A1): Let axiom A1 "Dummy axiom for demonstration purposes" be included (postulated) in T1.

Inference rule (axiom-interpretation): Let inference-rule axiom-interpretation defined as "(A, P |- P)" be included and considered valid in T1.

Proposition (T1.P1): (r1(o1, o2) ==> r2(o3)). Proof: "Dummy axiom for demonstration purposes" is postulated by axiom (A1). (r1(o1, o2) ==> r2(o3)) is a propositional formula interpreted from that axiom. Therefore, by the axiom-interpretation inference rule: (A, P |- P), it follows that (r1(o1, o2) ==> r2(o3)). QED

Proposition (T1.P2): r1(o1, o2). Proof: "Dummy axiom for demonstration purposes" is postulated by axiom (A1). r1(o1, o2) is a propositional formula interpreted from that axiom. Therefore, by the axiom-interpretation inference rule: (A, P |- P), it follows that r1(o1, o2). QED

Inference rule (modus-ponens): Let inference-rule modus-ponens defined as "((P1 ==> Q1), P1 |- Q1)" be included and considered valid in T1.

Proposition (T1.P3) - The proposition of interest: r2(o3). Proof: (r1(o1, o2) ==> r2(o3)) follows from prop. (P1).r1(o1, o2) follows from prop. (P2). Therefore, by the modus-ponens inference rule: ((P1 ==> Q1), P1 |- Q1), it follows that r2(o3). QED
