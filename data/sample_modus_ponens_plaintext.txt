Let "U35" be a universe-of-discourse.

Let "T1" be a theory-elaboration-sequence in U35.

Axiom (T1.A1): Let axiom A1 "Dummy axiom for demonstration purposes" be included (postulated) in T1.

Inference rule (axiom-interpretation): Let inference-rule axiom-interpretation defined as "A |- P" be included and considered valid in T1.

Proposition (T1.P1): (r1(o1, o2) ==> r2(o3)). Proof: "Dummy axiom for demonstration purposes" is postulated by axiom (A1). (r1(o1, o2) ==> r2(o3)) is a valid formula statement interpreted from that axiom.Therefore, by the axiom-interpretation inference rule: A |- P, it follows that (r1(o1, o2) ==> r2(o3)). QED

Warning (warning1): By design, punctilious assures the syntactical correctness of theories, but does not perform any semantic verification. Therefore, the usage of inference-rules that interpret natural content (i.e. axiom-interpretation and definition-interpretation) is critically dependent on the correctness of the content translation performed by the theory author, from axiom or definition natural language, to formulae.

Proposition (T1.P2): r1(o1, o2). Proof: "Dummy axiom for demonstration purposes" is postulated by axiom (A1). r1(o1, o2) is a valid formula statement interpreted from that axiom.Therefore, by the axiom-interpretation inference rule: A |- P, it follows that r1(o1, o2). QED

Inference rule (modus-ponens): Let inference-rule modus-ponens defined as "(((P1 ==> P1) , P1) |- Q1)" be included and considered valid in T1.

Proposition (T1.P3) - The proposition of interest: r2(o3). Proof: (r1(o1, o2) ==> r2(o3)) follows from prop. (P1).r1(o1, o2) follows from prop. (P2).Therefore, by the modus-ponens inference rule: (((P1 ==> P1) , P1) |- Q1), it follows that r2(o3). QED
