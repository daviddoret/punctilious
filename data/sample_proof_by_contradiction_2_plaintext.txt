Let "U41" be a universe-of-discourse.

Let "T1" be a theory-elaboration-sequence in U41.

Axiom (T1.A1): Let axiom A1 "Dummy axiom for demonstration purposes" be included (postulated) in T1.

Inference rule (axiom-interpretation): Let inference-rule axiom-interpretation defined as "A |- P" be included and considered valid in T1.

Proposition (T1.P1): (f1(o1) = f1(o2)). Proof: "Dummy axiom for demonstration purposes" is postulated by axiom (A1). (f1(o1) = f1(o2)) is a valid formula statement interpreted from that axiom.Therefore, by the axiom-interpretation inference rule: A |- P, it follows that (f1(o1) = f1(o2)). QED

Warning (warning1): By design, punctilious assures the syntactical correctness of theories, but does not perform any semantic verification. Therefore, the usage of inference-rules that interpret natural content (i.e. axiom-interpretation and definition-interpretation) is critically dependent on the correctness of the content translation performed by the theory author, from axiom or definition natural language, to formulae.

Proposition (T1.P2): ((f1(x1) = f1(y1)) ==> (x1 = y1)). Proof: "Dummy axiom for demonstration purposes" is postulated by axiom (A1). ((f1(x1) = f1(y1)) ==> (x1 = y1)) is a valid formula statement interpreted from that axiom.Therefore, by the axiom-interpretation inference rule: A |- P, it follows that ((f1(x1) = f1(y1)) ==> (x1 = y1)). QED

Axiom (H1.A2): Let axiom A2 "By hypothesis, assume (o1 neq o2) is true." be included (postulated) in H1.

Inference rule (axiom-interpretation): Let inference-rule axiom-interpretation defined as "A |- P" be included and considered valid in H1.

Proposition (H1.P3): (o1 neq o2). Proof: "By hypothesis, assume (o1 neq o2) is true." is postulated by axiom (A2). (o1 neq o2) is a valid formula statement interpreted from that axiom.Therefore, by the axiom-interpretation inference rule: A |- P, it follows that (o1 neq o2). QED

Warning (warning2): By design, punctilious assures the syntactical correctness of theories, but does not perform any semantic verification. Therefore, the usage of inference-rules that interpret natural content (i.e. axiom-interpretation and definition-interpretation) is critically dependent on the correctness of the content translation performed by the theory author, from axiom or definition natural language, to formulae.

Hypothesis (T1.H1) - We pose the negation hypothesis: (o1 neq o2). This hypothesis is elaborated in theory H1.

Inference rule (variable-substitution): Let inference-rule variable-substitution defined as "(P, Phi) |- P'" be included and considered valid in H1.

Proposition (H1.P4): ((f1(o1) = f1(o2)) ==> (o1 = o2)). Proof: ((f1(x1) = f1(y1)) ==> (x1 = y1)) follows from prop. (P2). Let x1 = o1, y1 = o2.Therefore, by the variable-substitution inference rule: (P, Phi) |- P', it follows that ((f1(o1) = f1(o2)) ==> (o1 = o2)). QED

Inference rule (modus-ponens): Let inference-rule modus-ponens defined as "(((P1 ==> P1) , P1) |- Q1)" be included and considered valid in H1.

Proposition (H1.P5): (o1 = o2). Proof: ((f1(o1) = f1(o2)) ==> (o1 = o2)) follows from prop. (P4).(f1(o1) = f1(o2)) follows from prop. (P1).Therefore, by the modus-ponens inference rule: (((P1 ==> P1) , P1) |- Q1), it follows that (o1 = o2). QED

Let "T2" be a theory-elaboration-sequence in U41.

Inference rule (inconsistency-introduction-2): Let inference-rule inconsistency-introduction-2 defined as "((P = Q), (P neq Q)) |- Inc(T)" be included and considered valid in T2.

Proposition (T2.P6) - The proposition of interest: Inc(H1). Proof: Let (P = Q) := (o1 = o2) follows from prop. (P5). Let (P neq Q)) := (o1 neq o2) follows from prop. (P3). Therefore, by the inconsistency-introduction-2 inference rule: ((P = Q), (P neq Q)) |- Inc(T), it follows that Inc(H1). QED

Inference rule (proof-by-contradiction-2): Let inference-rule proof-by-contradiction-2 defined as "(𝓗 𝑎𝑠𝑠𝑢𝑚𝑒 (𝑷 ≠ 𝑸), 𝐼𝑛𝑐(𝓗)) ⊢ (𝑷 = 𝑸)" be included and considered valid in T1.

Proposition (T1.P7) - The proposition of interest: (o1 = o2). Proof: Let hyp. (H1) be the hypothesis (o1 neq o2). Inc(H1) follows from prop. (P6).Therefore, by the proof-by-contradiction-2 inference rule: (𝓗 𝑎𝑠𝑠𝑢𝑚𝑒 (𝑷 ≠ 𝑸), 𝐼𝑛𝑐(𝓗)) ⊢ (𝑷 = 𝑸), it follows that (o1 = o2). QED
