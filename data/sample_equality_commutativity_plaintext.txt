Let "U37" be a universe-of-discourse.

Let "T1" be a theory-elaboration-sequence in U37.

Axiom (T1.A1): Let axiom A1 "Dummy axiom for demonstration purposes" be included (postulated) in T1.

Inference rule (axiom-interpretation): Let inference-rule axiom-interpretation defined as "(A2, P1 |- P1)" be included and considered valid in T1.

Proposition (T1.P1): (r1(o1, o2) = r2(o3)). Proof: "Dummy axiom for demonstration purposes" is postulated by axiom (A1). (r1(o1, o2) = r2(o3)) is a valid formula statement interpreted from that axiom.Therefore, by the  inference rule: (A2, P1 |- P1), it follows that (r1(o1, o2) = r2(o3)). QED

Inference rule (equality-commutativity): Let inference-rule equality-commutativity defined as "((x3 = y3) |- (y3 = x3))" be included and considered valid in T1.

Proposition (T1.P2) - The proposition of interest: (r2(o3) = r1(o1, o2)). Proof: (r1(o1, o2) = r2(o3)) follows from prop. (P1). Therefore, by the  inference rule: ((x3 = y3) |- (y3 = x3)), it follows that (r2(o3) = r1(o1, o2)). QED
