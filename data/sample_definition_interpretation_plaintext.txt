Let "U19" be a universe-of-discourse.

Let "T1" be a theory-derivation in U19.

Definition (T1.D1): Let definition D1 "Dummy definition for demonstration purposes" be included (postulated) in T1.

Inference rule (definition-interpretation): Let inference-rule definition-interpretation defined as "(D, x, y |- (x = y))" be included and considered valid in T1.

Proposition (T1.P1) - The proposition of interest: (r1(o1, o2) = r2(o3)). Proof: "Dummy definition for demonstration purposes" is postulated by def. (D1). r1(o1, o2) is an interpretation of that definition. Therefore, by the definition-interpretation inference rule: (D, x, y |- (x = y)), it follows that (r1(o1, o2) = r2(o3)). QED
