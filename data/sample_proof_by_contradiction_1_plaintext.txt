Let "U57" be a universe-of-discourse.

Let "T1" be a theory-derivation in U57.

Axiom (T1.A1): Let axiom A1 "Dummy axiom to establish some ground propositions." be included (postulated) in T1.

Inference rule (axiom-interpretation): Let inference-rule axiom-interpretation defined as "(A2, P1 |- P1)" be included and considered valid in T1.

Proposition (T1.P1): f1(o1, o2).

Proposition (T1.P2): f1(o2, o3).

Proposition (T1.P3): ((f1(x3, y3) and f1(y3, z1)) ==> f1(x3, z1)).

Axiom (H1.A2): Let axiom A4 "By hypothesis, assume not(f1(o1, o3)) is true." be included (postulated) in H1.

Inference rule (axiom-interpretation): Let inference-rule axiom-interpretation defined as "(A2, P1 |- P1)" be included and considered valid in H1.

Proposition (H1.P4): not(f1(o1, o3)).

Hypothesis (T1.H1) - We pose the negation hypothesis: not(f1(o1, o3)). This hypothesis is elaborated in theory H1.

Proposition (H1.P5): (f1(o1, o2) and f1(o2, o3)).

Inference rule (variable-substitution): Let inference-rule variable-substitution defined as "(P4, O1 |- Q2)" be included and considered valid in H1.

Proposition (H1.P6): ((f1(o1, o2) and f1(o2, o3)) ==> f1(o1, o3)).

Inference rule (modus-ponens): Let inference-rule modus-ponens defined as "((P6 ==> Q3), P6 |- Q3)" be included and considered valid in H1.

Proposition (H1.P7): f1(o1, o3).

Inference rule (inconsistency-introduction-1): Let inference-rule inconsistency-introduction-1 defined as "(P9, not(P9) |- Inc(T1))" be included and considered valid in T1.

Proposition (T1.P8) - Proof of the hypothesis inconsistency: Inc(H1). Proof: Let P := f1(o1, o3), which follows from prop. (P7). Let not(P) := not(f1(o1, o3)), which follows from prop. (P4). Therefore, by the  inference rule: (P9, not(P9) |- Inc(T1)), it follows that Inc(H1). QED

Inference rule (proof-by-contradiction-1): Let inference-rule proof-by-contradiction-1 defined as "((H1 formulate not(P12)), Inc(H1) |- P12)" be included and considered valid in T1.

Proposition (T1.P9) - The proposition of interest: f1(o1, o3). Proof: Let hyp. (H1) be the hypothesis not(f1(o1, o3)). Inc(H1) follows from prop. (P8).Therefore, by the  inference rule: ((H1 formulate not(P12)), Inc(H1) |- P12), it follows that f1(o1, o3). QED
