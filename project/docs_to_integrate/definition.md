TODO: Rewrite definition.

A _contentual-definition_ is a theory-statement that expresses a definition in natural-language.

A definition is a conservative-extension of a theory, i.e. it may be convenient to prove theorems
but per se it does not prove new theorems. In this regard, it is distinct from an axiom.
