# direct-axiom-inference

## Definition

A *direct-axiom-inference* is a *proposition* that follows directly from an *axiom*.
Equivalently, a *direct-axiom-inference* is a translation of an *axiom* natural language
in a *formula-statement*.

## Warning

Punctilious does not interpret the natural language of *axioms*,
the correctness of *direct-axiom-inferences* is solely dependent on the correctness of the
*axiom* translation work performed by the user.
