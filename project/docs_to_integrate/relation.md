# Connective

# Punctilious Definition

A _connective_ is a _formula_ that signals the presence of a mathematical
connective in a formula.

It is a tuple (U, s, n) where:

- U is the universe-of-discourse,
- s is a unique symbol,
- n is natural number strictly greater than 0 called the arity of the connective.
