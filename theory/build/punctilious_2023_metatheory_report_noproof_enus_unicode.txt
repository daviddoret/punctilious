Axiom 2: “A theory is a... (define punctilious data model).”

Axiom 4: “An (axiomatic) class is a collection of theoretical objects
	that are unambiguously defined by the axioms of the theory it belongs
	to.”

Axiom 6: “The class of classes is the class of all classes defined in
	the universe-of-discourse (TODO: Or foundation theory?).”

Proposition 3: (class-of-classes ∈ class-of-classes)

Axiom 8: “The theory-class is the class of all theories”

Proposition 5: (theory-class ∈ class-of-classes)

Proposition 6: (inference rule 1 ∈ theory-class)

Axiom 10: “truth-values is the class whose elements are the
	formulas truth and falsehood.”

Proposition 8: (truth-values ∈ class-of-classes)

Proposition 9: (true ∈ truth-values)

Proposition 10: (false ∈ truth-values)

Axiom 12: “propositional-connectives is the class whose elements are the
	connectives: conjunction, disjunction, implication, and negation, and
	any connective defined from these.”

Proposition 12: (propositional-connectives-class ∈ class-of-classes)

Proposition 13: (∧ ∈ propositional-connectives-class)

Proposition 14: (∨ ∈ propositional-connectives-class)

Proposition 15: (⟹ ∈ propositional-connectives-class)

Proposition 16: (¬ ∈ propositional-connectives-class)

Proposition 17: (≠ ∈ propositional-connectives-class)

Axiom 14: “= is a binary connective such that, given any two
	theoretical-objcts x and y, if x=y then y=x, and for every statement
	s, s is valid iif subst s is valid.”

Proposition 19: ((x₁ = y₁) ⟹ (y₁ = x₁))

Definition 20: “Inequality is defined as the negation of equality.”

Formal definition 21: ((x₂ ≠ y₂) = ¬((x₂ = y₂)))

Axiom 16: “propositions is a class whose elements are truth,
	falsehood, all elements of the theory-formula-statement class, whose
	connective is an element-of propositional-connectives-class, and all
	theory-formula-statements whose connective is defined from these. Its
	elements are called propositions.”

Proposition 23: (true ∈ class-of-classes)

Proposition 24: (false ∈ class-of-classes)

Axiom 18: “If P is a proposition, then either the statement P has
	truth value true,or the statement P has truth value falsehood.”

Proposition 26: (true is true)

Proposition 27: (false is false)

Axiom 20: “¬ is a unary connective. If P is a proposition and it has
	truth-value truth, then ¬P has-truth-value false. Conversely, if P is
	a proposition and it has truth-value falsehood, then ¬P has
	truth-value true.”

Axiom 22: “If P has-truth-value t, ¬(¬(P)) has-truth-value t.”

Proposition 30: ((𝐱₁ is 𝐱₂) ⟹ (¬(¬(𝐱₁)) is 𝐱₂))

Axiom 24: “If P and Q are logical propositions, (P ∧ Q) is true if and
	only if both P and Q are true, otherwise it is false.”

Axiom 26: “If P and Q are logical propositions, (P ⇔ Q) is true if and
	only if ((P ⇒ Q) ∧ (Q ⇒ P)), otherwise it is false.”

Axiom 28: “If T is a theory, and both P is valid and ¬P is valid in T,
	then this theory is an element of contradictory-theories class.”

Proposition 34: (((φ is true) ∧ (φ is false)) ⟹ (φ ∈ contradictory-statement))
