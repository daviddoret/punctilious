𝐄𝐱𝐭𝐞𝐧𝐝𝐞𝐝 𝐭𝐡𝐞𝐨𝐫𝐢𝐞𝐬:
The following theories are extended by 𝐟𝐨𝐮𝐧𝐝𝐚𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧-𝐭𝐡𝐞𝐨𝐫𝐲.

𝐒𝐢𝐦𝐩𝐥𝐞-𝐨𝐛𝐣𝐜𝐭 𝐝𝐞𝐜𝐥𝐚𝐫𝐚𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧𝐬:
Let true be a simple-objct denoted as ⌜ true ⌝.
Let false be a simple-objct denoted as ⌜ false ⌝.

𝐑𝐞𝐥𝐚𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧 𝐝𝐞𝐜𝐥𝐚𝐫𝐚𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧𝐬:
Let implies be a binary relation denoted as ⌜ implies ⌝, that signals well-formed formulae in infix-operator syntax (e.g.: ⌜ 𝐱₁ implies 𝐱₂ ⌝).
Let = be a binary relation denoted as ⌜ = ⌝, that signals well-formed formulae in infix-operator syntax (e.g.: ⌜ 𝐱₁ = 𝐱₂ ⌝).

𝐓𝐡𝐞𝐨𝐫𝐲 𝐞𝐥𝐚𝐛𝐨𝐫𝐚𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧:

𝐀𝐱𝐢𝐨𝐦-1: = is a binary relation such that, given any two theoretical-objcts x and y, if x=y then y=x, and for every statement including x or y, the same statement is valid with the other. 

𝐏𝐫𝐨𝐩𝐨𝐬𝐢𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧-2: ((𝐱₁ = 𝐱₂) implies (𝐱₂ = 𝐱₁))
