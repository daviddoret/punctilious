𝐄𝐱𝐭𝐞𝐧𝐝𝐞𝐝 𝐭𝐡𝐞𝐨𝐫𝐢𝐞𝐬:
The following theories are extended by 𝐟𝐨𝐮𝐧𝐝𝐚𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧-𝐭𝐡𝐞𝐨𝐫𝐲.

𝐒𝐢𝐦𝐩𝐥𝐞-𝐨𝐛𝐣𝐜𝐭 𝐝𝐞𝐜𝐥𝐚𝐫𝐚𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧𝐬:
Let true be a simple-objct denoted as ⌜ true ⌝.
Let false be a simple-objct denoted as ⌜ false ⌝.

𝐑𝐞𝐥𝐚𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧 𝐝𝐞𝐜𝐥𝐚𝐫𝐚𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧𝐬:
Let implies be a binary relation denoted as ⌜ implies ⌝, that signals well-formed formulae in infix-operator syntax (e.g.: ⌜ 𝐱₁ implies 𝐱₂ ⌝).
Let = be a binary relation denoted as ⌜ = ⌝, that signals well-formed formulae in infix-operator syntax (e.g.: ⌜ 𝐱₁ = 𝐱₂ ⌝).
Let subst be a ternary relation denoted as ⌜ subst ⌝, that signals well-formed formulae in function-call syntax (e.g.: ⌜ subst(𝐱₁, 𝐱₂ ,… ,𝐱ₙ) ⌝).

𝐍𝐚𝐭𝐮𝐫𝐚𝐥 𝐥𝐚𝐧𝐠𝐮𝐚𝐠𝐞 𝐚𝐱𝐢𝐨𝐦 𝟏: “= is a binary relation such that, given any
	two theoretical-objcts x and y, if x=y then y=x, and for every
	statement s, s is valid iif subst s is valid.”

𝐅𝐨𝐫𝐦𝐚𝐥 𝐚𝐱𝐢𝐨𝐦 𝟐: ((𝐱₁ = 𝐱₂) implies (𝐱₂ = 𝐱₁))

	((𝐱₁ = 𝐱₂) implies (𝐱₂ = 𝐱₁))                                          │ Follows from 𝐧𝐚𝐭𝐮𝐫𝐚𝐥 𝐥𝐚𝐧𝐠𝐮𝐚𝐠𝐞 𝐚𝐱𝐢𝐨𝐦 𝟏.

𝐍𝐚𝐭𝐮𝐫𝐚𝐥 𝐥𝐚𝐧𝐠𝐮𝐚𝐠𝐞 𝐝𝐞𝐟𝐢𝐧𝐢𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧 𝟑: “substitution is the process that
	consists in taking 3 theoretical-object o, p and q, that may be a
	composed-object such as a formula, and replacing in there all
	occurences of p by q.”

𝐍𝐚𝐭𝐮𝐫𝐚𝐥 𝐥𝐚𝐧𝐠𝐮𝐚𝐠𝐞 𝐚𝐱𝐢𝐨𝐦 𝟒: “If x = y, o = subst(o, x, y) where o, x,
	and y are theoretical-objcts.”

𝐅𝐨𝐫𝐦𝐚𝐥 𝐚𝐱𝐢𝐨𝐦 𝟓: ((𝐱₃ = 𝐱₄) implies subst(𝐱₅, 𝐱₃, 𝐱₄))
	𝐃𝐞𝐫𝐢𝐯𝐚𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧 𝐟𝐫𝐨𝐦 𝐧𝐚𝐭𝐮𝐫𝐚𝐥 𝐥𝐚𝐧𝐠𝐮𝐚𝐠𝐞 𝐚𝐱𝐢𝐨𝐦
	((𝐱₃ = 𝐱₄) implies subst(𝐱₅, 𝐱₃, 𝐱₄))                                  │ Follows from 𝐧𝐚𝐭𝐮𝐫𝐚𝐥 𝐥𝐚𝐧𝐠𝐮𝐚𝐠𝐞 𝐚𝐱𝐢𝐨𝐦 𝟒.
