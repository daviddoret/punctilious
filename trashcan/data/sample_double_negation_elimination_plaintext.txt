Let "U33" be a universe-of-discourse.

Let "T1" be a theory-derivation in U33.

Axiom (T1.A1): Let axiom A1 "Dummy axiom for demonstration purposes" be included (postulated) in T1.

Inference rule (axiom-interpretation): Let inference-rule axiom-interpretation defined as "(A, P |- P)" be included and considered valid in T1.

Proposition (T1.P1): not(not(r1(o1, o2))). Proof: "Dummy axiom for demonstration purposes" is postulated by axiom (A1). not(not(r1(o1, o2))) is a propositional formula interpreted from that axiom. Therefore, by the axiom-interpretation inference rule: (A, P |- P), it follows that not(not(r1(o1, o2))). QED

Inference rule (double-negation-elimination): Let inference-rule double-negation-elimination defined as "(not(not(P1)) |- P1)" be included and considered valid in T1.

Proposition (T1.P2) - The proposition of interest: r1(o1, o2). Proof: not(not(r1(o1, o2))), of the form not(not(P1)), follows from prop. (P1).  Therefore, by the double-negation-elimination inference rule: (not(not(P1)) |- P1), it follows that r1(o1, o2). QED
