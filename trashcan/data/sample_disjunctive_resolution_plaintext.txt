Let "U27" be a universe-of-discourse.

Let "T1" be a theory-derivation in U27.

Axiom (T1.A1): Let axiom A1 "Dummy axiom for demonstration purposes" be included (postulated) in T1.

Inference rule (axiom-interpretation): Let inference-rule axiom-interpretation defined as "(A, P |- P)" be included and considered valid in T1.

Proposition (T1.P1): (o1 or o2). Proof: "Dummy axiom for demonstration purposes" is postulated by axiom (A1). (o1 or o2) is a propositional formula interpreted from that axiom. Therefore, by the axiom-interpretation inference rule: (A, P |- P), it follows that (o1 or o2). QED

Proposition (T1.P2): (not(o1) or o3). Proof: "Dummy axiom for demonstration purposes" is postulated by axiom (A1). (not(o1) or o3) is a propositional formula interpreted from that axiom. Therefore, by the axiom-interpretation inference rule: (A, P |- P), it follows that (not(o1) or o3). QED

Inference rule (disjunctive-resolution): Let inference-rule disjunctive-resolution defined as "((P1 or Q1), (not(P1) or R1) |- (P1 or R1))" be included and considered valid in T1.

Proposition (T1.P3) - The proposition of interest: (o2 or o3). Proof: (o1 or o2), of the form (P1 or Q1), follows from prop. (P1). P2, of the form (not(P1) or R1), is given.  Therefore, by the disjunctive-resolution inference rule: ((P1 or Q1), (not(P1) or R1) |- (P1 or R1)), it follows that (o2 or o3). QED
