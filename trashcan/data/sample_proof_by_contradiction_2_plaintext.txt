Let "U67" be a universe-of-discourse.

Let "T1" be a theory-derivation in U67.

Axiom (T1.A1): Let axiom A1 "Dummy axiom for demonstration purposes" be included (postulated) in T1.

Inference rule (axiom-interpretation): Let inference-rule axiom-interpretation defined as "(A, P |- P)" be included and considered valid in T1.

Proposition (T1.P1): (f(o1) = f(o2)).

Proposition (T1.P2): ((f(x1) = f(y1)) ==> (x1 = y1)).

Axiom (H1.A2): Let axiom A2 "By hypothesis, assume (o1 neq o2) is true." be included (postulated) in H1.

Inference rule (axiom-interpretation): Let inference-rule axiom-interpretation defined as "(A, P |- P)" be included and considered valid in H1.

Proposition (H1.P3): (o1 neq o2).

Hypothesis (T1.H1) - We pose the negation hypothesis: (o1 neq o2). This hypothesis is elaborated in theory H1.

Inference rule (variable-substitution): Let inference-rule variable-substitution defined as "(P1, O1 |- Q1)" be included and considered valid in H1.

Proposition (H1.P4): ((f(o1) = f(o2)) ==> (o1 = o2)).

Inference rule (modus-ponens): Let inference-rule modus-ponens defined as "((P3 ==> Q2), P3 |- Q2)" be included and considered valid in H1.

Proposition (H1.P5): (o1 = o2).

Inference rule (inconsistency-introduction-2): Let inference-rule inconsistency-introduction-2 defined as "((P6 = Q4), (P6 neq Q4) |- Inc(T1))" be included and considered valid in T1.

Proposition (T1.P6) - Proof of hypothesis inconsistency: Inc(H1). Proof: Let (P = Q) := (o1 = o2) follows from prop. (P5). Let (P neq Q)) := (o1 neq o2) follows from prop. (P3).  Therefore, by the inconsistency-introduction-2 inference rule: ((P6 = Q4), (P6 neq Q4) |- Inc(T1)), it follows that Inc(H1). QED

Inference rule (proof-by-contradiction-2): Let inference-rule proof-by-contradiction-2 defined as "((H1 formulate (x4 neq y4)), Inc(H1) |- (x4 = y4))" be included and considered valid in T1.

Proposition (T1.P7) - The proposition of interest: (o1 = o2). Proof: Let hyp. (H1) be the hypothesis (o1 neq o2). Inc(H1) follows from prop. (P6). Therefore, by the proof-by-contradiction-2 inference rule: ((H1 formulate (x4 neq y4)), Inc(H1) |- (x4 = y4)), it follows that (o1 = o2). QED
