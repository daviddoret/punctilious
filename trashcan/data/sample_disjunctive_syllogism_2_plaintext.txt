Let "U31" be a universe-of-discourse.

Let "T1" be a theory-derivation in U31.

Axiom (T1.A1): Let axiom A1 "Dummy axiom for demonstration purposes" be included (postulated) in T1.

Inference rule (axiom-interpretation): Let inference-rule axiom-interpretation defined as "(A, P |- P)" be included and considered valid in T1.

Proposition (T1.P1): ((o1 ==> o3) or (o1 ==> o4)). Proof: "Dummy axiom for demonstration purposes" is postulated by axiom (A1). ((o1 ==> o3) or (o1 ==> o4)) is a propositional formula interpreted from that axiom. Therefore, by the axiom-interpretation inference rule: (A, P |- P), it follows that ((o1 ==> o3) or (o1 ==> o4)). QED

Proposition (T1.P2): not((o1 ==> o4)). Proof: "Dummy axiom for demonstration purposes" is postulated by axiom (A1). not((o1 ==> o4)) is a propositional formula interpreted from that axiom. Therefore, by the axiom-interpretation inference rule: (A, P |- P), it follows that not((o1 ==> o4)). QED

Inference rule (disjunctive-syllogism-2): Let inference-rule disjunctive-syllogism-2 defined as "((P1 or Q1), not(P1) |- Q1)" be included and considered valid in T1.

Proposition (T1.P3) - The proposition of interest: (o1 ==> o3). Proof: ((o1 ==> o3) or (o1 ==> o4)), of the form (P1 or Q1), follows from prop. (P1). P2, of the form not(P1), is given.  Therefore, by the disjunctive-syllogism-2 inference rule: ((P1 or Q1), not(P1) |- Q1), it follows that (o1 ==> o3). QED
