## Notation

≜

## Definition

Two formulas 𝑜₁ and 𝑜₂ are definition-equal if and only if:

* 𝑜₁ and 𝑜₂ are reference to the same object-declaration.

## Note

Consider that an object 𝑜₁ has been declared in a universe-of-discourse. Note that by definition, an object can only be
declared once. This declaration brings that object to "life". Whatever later references, names, or symbols we use to
speak about that object, definitional-equality mean that we are speaking about that original object.
