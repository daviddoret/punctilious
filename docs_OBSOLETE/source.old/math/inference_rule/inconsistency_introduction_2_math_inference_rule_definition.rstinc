*inconsistency-introduction-2* is the :ref:`inference-rule<inference_rule_math_concept>`:

.. math::

   \left(\left(x = y\right), \left(x \neq y\right)\right) \vdash Inc\left(\mathcal{T}\right)

In straightforward language, if we prove both the equality and inequality of two terms, it follows that the theory is inconsistent.

   A proof of consistency will have to show, by appealing to contentual considerations which are completely unproblematic, that in the formalism in question it is never possible to derive the formula 𝑎 ≠ 𝑎, or alternatively it is not possible to prove both 𝑎 = 𝑏 and 𝑎 ≠ 𝑏. :cite:p:`mgz_2021_introductionprooftheory{p. 5}`
