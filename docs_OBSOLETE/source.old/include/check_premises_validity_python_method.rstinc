This python method verifies the validity of the premises. It is called by the python constructor of the :ref:`InferredStatement<inferred_statement_python_class>` python class to assure that :ref:`formula-statements<formula_statement_math_concept>` are inferred if and only if they are valid.

Returns True if the premises are valid and allow the execution of the inference algorithm. In this case, the constructor of the :ref:`InferredStatement<inferred_statement_python_class>` class will succeed and create an :ref:`InferredStatement<inferred_statement_python_class>` instance.

Returns False if the premises are *not* valid and *do not* allow the execution of the inference algorithm. In this case, the constructor of the :ref:`InferredStatement<inferred_statement_python_class>` class will fail and raise a PunctiliousException error.
