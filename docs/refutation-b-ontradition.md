# refutation by contradiction

## Quotes

> Refutation by contradiction is the “basic” method of formal proof for proving a negation: if assuming P leads to a
> contradiction, then we conclude ¬P. It is the introduction rule for the connective of negation in intuitionistic
> logic; if ¬P is defined as P → ⊥ (the function type from P to false), then it follows from the introduction rule for
> implication. (nLab, 2017, Refutation by contradiction)
