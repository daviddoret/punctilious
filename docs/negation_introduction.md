(Jongsma 2019, pp. 76-77) uses Negation Introduction (NI) and Negation Elimination (NE). As follows:

Negation Introduction:
Assume P
Derive Q
Derive not Q
It follows that not P

Negation Elimination:
Assume not P
Derive Q
Derive not Q
It follows that P

The punctilious package uses the terms proof-by-contradiction and proof-by-refutation instead.
