# Relation

# Punctilious Definition

A _relation_ is a _theoretical-object_ that signals the presence of a mathematical
relation in a formula.

It is a tuple (U, s, n) where:

- U is the universe-of-discourse,
- s is a unique symbol,
- n is natural number strictly greater than 0 called the arity of the relation.
