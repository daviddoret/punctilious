Definition
-----------

An *atomic-formula* is a :ref:`formula<formula_math_concept>` that is not composed of a connective and terms. Equivalently, it is a leaf is a formula tree.

Note that several definitions may be found in the litterature. :cite:p:`cook_2009_dictionaryphilosophicallogic{p. 20}` defines it as a single-n-ary predicate followed by n singular terms. In the context of *punctilious*, we rather adopt the definition proposed by :cite:p:`moller_2013_modellingcomputingsystems{p. 55}` where variables, *true*, and *false* are examples of atomic formula and where single-predicate formulae are considered compound formulae.

   An atomic formula (or atom, or simple formula) is a formula that consists of a single n-ary predicate followed by n singular terms. Note that the terms might be simple or complex, and might be, or contain, either constants or variables.

   *atomic formula* Let L be a first order language. An atomic formula is an expression which has the form P(t1,...,tn), where P is an n-place predicate symbol of L and t1,...,tn are terms of L. If L contains equality (=), then = is viewed as a two-place predicate. Consequently, if t1 and t2 are terms, then t1 = t2 is an atomic formula.
