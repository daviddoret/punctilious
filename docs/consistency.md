# Consistency

## Quotes

> The property of a formal system requiring that not every formula of the system is
> provable in it. Formal systems having this property are called consistent or formally
> consistent. In the opposite case the formal system is called contradictory or
> inconsistent. For the broad class of formal systems whose language contains the negation
> symbol ¬, consistency is equivalent to the property that "there is no formula ϕ
> such that both ϕ and ¬ϕ are provable". A class of formulas of a given formal system is
> called consistent if not every formula of the system is deducible from the given
> class.
