object-inclusion
===================

Definition
----------

An *object-inclusion* is a statement* that an object declared in a :ref:`universe_of_discourse_math_concept` is a constitutive element of a :ref:`theory_elaboration_sequence_math_concept`.

*. Here, statement is considered in its general meaning, distinct from :doc:`theory_statement`.

In straightforward language, an *object-inclusion* extends a :ref:`theory_elaboration_sequence_math_concept` with an object, which makes it possible to infer statements about that object.
