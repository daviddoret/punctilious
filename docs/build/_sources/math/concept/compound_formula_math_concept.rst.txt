   A compound formula (or complex formula, or molecule) is a formula that is composed of other, simpler formulas. Compound formulas are typically formed by prefixing a formula with negation (~), joining two or more statements together with a binary connective such as conjunction (∧), disjunction (v), or material implication (→), or by prefixing a formula with a quantifier (∃, ∀) or modal operator (:math:`\square`, :math:`\diamond`).
