object-inclusion

Definition
----------

An *object-inclusion* is the statement [footnote1]_ that an object declared in a :ref:`universe-of-discourse` is a constitutive element of a :ref:`theory-elaboration-sequence`.

In straightforward language, an *object-inclusion* extends a :ref:`theory-elaboration-sequence` with an object, which makes it possible to infer statements about that object.
