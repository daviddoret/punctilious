theory-derivation
===========================

Definition
----------

A *theory-derivation* is a tuple :math:`\left( \boldsymbol{I}, \boldsymbol{\Phi} \right)`

Where:

  * :math:`\boldsymbol{I}` is a finite collection of inference-rules,
  * :math:`\boldsymbol{\Phi}` is a finite sequence of formulas :math:`\boldsymbol{\phi_1}, \boldsymbol{\phi_1}, \ldots, \boldsymbol{\phi_n}` each of which is either an axiom schema, an axiom, a definition, or a propositional formula inferred from previous formula (including theorems of other theories being extended by this derivation) by one of the inference-rule in :math:`\boldsymbol{I}`.
