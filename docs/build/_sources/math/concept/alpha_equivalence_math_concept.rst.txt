alpha-equivalence
===================

.. seealso::
   :ref:`formula<formula_math_concept>`

Definition
-----------

Two formulas :math:`\\phi` and :math:`\psi` are :math:`\alpha\text{-equivalent}` if and only if they only differ by the names (i.e. symbolic representations) given to their variables.

.. note::
   As of today, *punctilious* is focused on the development of propositional logic. This definition applies to propositional logic but is not accurate for first-order logic. Considering the definition provided by :cite:p:`troelstra_2000_basicprooftheory`, in first-order logic *alpha-equivalence* should account for bound-variables but not free-variables. For this reason, once the development of *punctiolious* will cover first-order logic, we will need to refine these definitions and probably distinguish several types of *alpha-equivalences*.

Quotes

   Expressions :math:`\mathcal{E}`, :math:`\mathcal{E}'` which differ only in the names of bound variables will be regarded by us as identical. This is sometimes expressed by saying that :math:`\mathcal{E}` and :math:`\mathcal{E}'` are :math:`\alpha\text{-equivalent}` . In other words, we are only interested in certain equivalence classes of (the concrete representations of) expressions, expressions "modulo renaming of bound variables".
