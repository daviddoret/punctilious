alpha-equivalence
===================

   :ref:`formula<formula_math_concept>`

Definition
-----------

Two formula :math:`\phi` and :math:`\psi` are :math:`\alpha\text{-equivalent}` if and only if they only differ by the names (i.e. representations) given to their free-variables.

Quotes
------

   Expressions :math:`\mathcal{E}`, :math:`\mathcal{E}'` which differ only in the names of bound variables will be regarded by us as identical. This is sometimes expressed by saying that :math:`\mathcal{E}` and :math:`\mathcal{E}'` are :math:`\alpha`-equivalent. In other words, we are only interested in certain equivalence classes of (the concrete representations of) expressions, expressions "modulo renaming of bound variables".
