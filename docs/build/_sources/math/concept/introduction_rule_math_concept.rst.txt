Quotes
-------

    "Each of the introduction rules tells us how to derive a formula of some syntactic form. For instance, the conjunction introduction rule (∧I) shows that we can derive a conjunction if we derive both conjunctive terms; the disjunction introduction rules (∨I) show that we can derive a disjunction if we derive one of the disjunctive terms."
