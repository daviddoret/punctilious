Definition
----------

*inconsistency-by-inequality-introduction* is the :doc:`inference_rule`:

.. math::

    \left(P \implies Q\right) \vdash \left(P \implies P \land Q\right)


    A proof of consistency will have to show, by appealing to contentual considerations which are completely unproblematic, that in the formalism in question it is never possible to derive the formula 𝑎 ≠ 𝑎, or alternatively it is not possible to prove both 𝑎 = 𝑏 and 𝑎 ≠ 𝑏. :footcite:p:`astorino_2010`
