About *punctilious*
=========================



*Punctilious* is a *math proof assistant* python open-source development project. In clear: it intends to
facilitate the study and development of mathematical proofs by human beings.

There exists multiple math proof assistants, including:

* `Coq<https://coq.inria.fr/>`
* `Isabelle<https://isabelle.in.tum.de/>`
* `Lean<https://leanprover.github.io/>`

...and many more. The `proof assistant<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proof_assistant>` page on Wikipedia contains a
general-purpose comparison of these.

In contrast, *punctilious* is a ridiculous `Lilliputian<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lilliput_and_Blefuscu>` with
neither the length, nor the breadth of these time-proven systems.

So why develop yet another math proof assistant?
*****************************************************

Besides being fun and a thrilling learning experience, the focus points of *punctilious* are:

* Human-friendly and developer-friendly inputs (i.e.: write math as we learn it)
* Ease of use
* Human-friendly and developer-friendly outputs (i.e.: readable)

*Punctilious* does not pay much attention to:

* Performance (i.e. for large-scale proof applications)
