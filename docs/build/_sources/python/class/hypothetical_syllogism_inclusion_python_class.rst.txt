HypotheticalSyllogismInclusion (python class)

This section presents the :python:`HypotheticalSyllogismInclusion` python class.

This class models the :ref:`inclusion<object_inclusion_math_concept>` of the :ref:`hypothetical-syllogism<hypothetical_syllogism_math_inference_rule>` :ref:`inference-rule<inference_rule_math_concept>` in the target :ref:`theory-derivation<theory_derivation_math_concept>`.

*Punctilious* users do not need to instanciate objects from this class. In effect, the :python:`TheoryElaborationSequence` class exposes the :python:`hypothetical_syllogism` property, and instanciation is automatic when this property is accessed for the first time.
