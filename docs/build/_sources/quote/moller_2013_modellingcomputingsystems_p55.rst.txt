   (...) A statement written in propositional logic is called a *propositional formula*, and is either:

   - an *atomic formula*, typically represented by a variable such as P, Q, or R; or

   - a *compound formula*, in which case it is built up using the above propositional connectives as summarised in Figure 1.1

   There are two special atomic propositional formulae, *true* (representing the proposition which is always true) and *false* (representing the proposition which is always false).

   The above define the *syntax* of the language of propositional formulae. (...)
