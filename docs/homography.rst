.. _homography:

# Homography

## Definition

Two symbolic-objects 𝑜₁ and 𝑜₂ are homographs if and only if:

* They have equal symbols

## Note on the unicity or non-unicity constraint imposed on symbols in a universe-of-discourse

Originally, Punctilious imposed the unicity of symbols in universe-of-discourses as a strict constraint.
This constraint was later relaxed. The rationale behind this decision is that there are circumstances where homographs
are necessary. The elaboration of meta-theories is a probably a good example where this necessity arises, as we may wish
to elaborate a theory on a set of object theories that use homographs.
