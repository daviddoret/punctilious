DisjunctiveSyllogismInclusion (python class)

This section presents the :python:`DisjunctiveSyllogismInclusion` python class.

This class models the :ref:`inclusion<object_inclusion_math_concept>` of the :ref:`disjunctive-syllogism<disjunctive_syllogism_math_inference_rule>` :ref:`inference-rule<inference_rule_math_concept>` in the target :ref:`theory-elaboration-sequence<theory_elaboration_sequence_math_concept>`.

*Punctilious* users do not need to instanciate objects from this class. In effect, the :python:`TheoryElaborationSequence` class exposes the :python:`disjunctive_syllogism` property, and instanciation is automatic when this property is accessed for the first time.
