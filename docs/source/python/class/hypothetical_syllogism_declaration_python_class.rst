HypotheticalSyllogismDeclaration (python class)
========================================================================

This section presents the :python:`HypotheticalSyllogismDeclaration` python class.

This class models the :ref:`declaration<object_declaration_math_concept>` of the :ref:`hypothetical-syllogism<hypothetical_syllogism_math_inference_rule>` :ref:`inference-rule<inference_rule_math_concept>` in the target :ref:`universe-of-discourse<universe_of_discourse_math_concept>`.

*Punctilious* users do not need to instanciate objects from this class. In effect, the :python:`UniverseOfDiscourse` class exposes the :python:`hypothetical_syllogism` property, and instanciation is automatic when the property is accessed for the first time.
