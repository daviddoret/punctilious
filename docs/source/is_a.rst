is-a
==========

Definition
----------

In punctilious, *is-a* is a binary relation used to denote that an object belongs to an arbitrary collection of objects.

It is a design choice to not use the symbol :math:`\in` to distinguish this loose concept from set and class theories.

Python implementation
---------------------

is_a
^^^^

.. module:: core
    :noindex:
.. autoclass:: RelationDict
    :members: is_a
