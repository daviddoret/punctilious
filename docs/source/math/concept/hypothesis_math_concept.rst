hypothesis
========================================

Definition
----------

An *hypothesis* is a special statement, that branches out a child :ref:`theory-elaboration-sequence` from a parent :ref:`theory-elaboration-sequence`, and postulates a new :ref:`formula-statement` as true.

Note that an *hypothesis* is part of the theory sequence. It follows that its predecessor statements are contained in the hypothesis, and its successors are not.

In straightforward language, at any point of a theory elaboration, we may pose an hypothesis. That hypothesis is a new "what if" theory that assumes something new to be true.
