*conjunction-elimination-1* is the :ref:`inference-rule<inference_rule_math_concept>`:

.. math::

   \left( P \land Q \right) \vdash P

Where:

   * :math:`P \land Q` is a :ref:`formula-statement<formula_statement_math_concept>`
   * :math:`P` is a propositional :ref:`formula<formula_math_concept>`
   * :math:`Q` is a propositional :ref:`formula<formula_math_concept>`

In straightforward language, if both :math:`P` and :math:`Q` are true, it follows that :math:`P` is true.
