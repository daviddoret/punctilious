*inconsistency-introduction-3* is the :ref:`inference-rule`:

.. math::

In straightforward language, if we prove that an object is not equal to itself, it follows that the theory is inconsistent.

   A proof of consistency will have to show, by appealing to contentual considerations which are completely unproblematic, that in the formalism in question it is never possible to derive the formula 𝑎 ≠ 𝑎, or alternatively it is not possible to prove both 𝑎 = 𝑏 and 𝑎 ≠ 𝑏. :cite:p:`mancosu_2021_introductionprooftheorynormalization{p. 5}`
