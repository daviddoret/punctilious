*equal-terms-substitution* is the well-known and valid :ref:`inference-rule`:

.. math::

    \left( P, x = y \right) \vdash Q

Where:

* :math:`P` is a :ref:`formula-statement`
* :math:`x = y` is a :ref:`formula-statement` of the form :math:`x = y`
* :math:`Q` is a :ref:`formula-statement` identical to :math:`P` except that every occurrences of :math:`x` in :math:`P` are substituted with :math:`y`
