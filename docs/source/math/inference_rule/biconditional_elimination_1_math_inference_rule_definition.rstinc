*biconditional-elimination-1* is the :ref:`inference-rule`:

.. math::

   \left( P \iff Q \right) \vdash \left( P \implies Q \right)

Where:

* :math:`P \iff Q` is a :ref:`formula-statement`
* :math:`P` is a propositional :ref:`formula`
* :math:`Q` is a propositional :ref:`formula`

In straightforward language, if P is true if and only if Q is true, it follows that P implies Q.
