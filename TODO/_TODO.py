# NEXT STEPS

# TODO: UniverseOfDiscourse: Develop a declare_universe_of_discourse() method to allow the declaration of new universes-of-discourse as objects of a parent universe-of-discourse. See articles on creation and declaration for details.

# TODO: NICE_TO_HAVE: Add default text-style for classes in configuration, e.g. ScriptNormal for axiom-declaration and definition-declaration.
