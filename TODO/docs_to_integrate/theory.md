# theory

## Definition

A _theory_ 𝒯 is a tuple (𝒰, ℐ, 𝒜, 𝒮) where:

- 𝒰 is the universe-of-discourse,
- ℐ is a finite collection of inference-rules allowed by 𝒯,
- 𝒜 is a finite collection of axioms,
- 𝒮 is the finite or infinite collection of statements _derivable_ from the _axioms_ 𝒜, and with the _inference-rules_
  ℐ.

For readability purposes, a _theory_ 𝒯 is re-defined as a tuple (𝒰, ℐ, 𝒜, 𝒟, 𝒮) as above, but where:

- 𝒟 is a finite collection of _definitions_.
