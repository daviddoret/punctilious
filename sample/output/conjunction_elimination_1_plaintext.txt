Let "U10" be a universe-of-discourse.

Let "T1" be a theory-elaboration-sequence in U10.

Proposition (T1.P2) - The proposition of interest: r1(o1, o2). Proof: (r1(o1, o2) and r2(o3)), of the form (P1 and Q1), follows from prop. (P1). Therefore, by the conjunction-elimination-1 inference rule: ((P1 and Q1) |- P1), it follows that r1(o1, o2). QED
