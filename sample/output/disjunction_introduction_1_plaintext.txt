Let "U16" be a universe-of-discourse.

Let "T1" be a theory-elaboration-sequence in U16.

Axiom (T1.A1): Let axiom A1 "Dummy axiom for demonstration purposes" be included (postulated) in T1.

Proposition (T1.P1): r1(o1, o2). Proof: "Dummy axiom for demonstration purposes" is postulated by axiom (A1). r1(o1, o2) is a valid formula statement interpreted from that axiom.Therefore, by the axiom-interpretation inference rule: A |- P, it follows that r1(o1, o2). QED

Warning (warning1): By design, punctilious assures the syntactical correctness of theories, but does not perform any semantic verification. Therefore, the usage of inference-rules that interpret natural content (i.e. axiom-interpretation and definition-interpretation) is critically dependent on the correctness of the content translation performed by the theory author, from axiom or definition natural language, to formulae.

Proposition (T1.P2): (r2(o3) or r1(o1, o2)). Proof: r1(o1, o2), of the form P1, follows from prop. (P1). r2(o3), of the form Q1, is given. Therefore, by the disjunction-introduction-1 inference rule: (P1 |- (Q1 or P1)), it follows that (r2(o3) or r1(o1, o2)). QED
