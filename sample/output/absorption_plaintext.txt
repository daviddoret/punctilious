Let "U2" be a universe-of-discourse.

Let "T1" be a theory-elaboration-sequence in U2.

Proposition (T1.P2) - The proposition of interest: (r1(o1, o2) ==> (r1(o1, o2) and r2(o3))). Proof: (r1(o1, o2) ==> r2(o3)) follows from prop. (P1). (r1(o1, o2) ==> (r1(o1, o2) and r2(o3))) follows from the application of the absorption inference-rule: ((P1 ==> Q1) |- (P1 ==> (P1 and Q1))).Therefore, by the absorption inference rule: ((P1 ==> Q1) |- (P1 ==> (P1 and Q1))), it follows that (r1(o1, o2) ==> (r1(o1, o2) and r2(o3))).
