Let "U26" be a universe-of-discourse.

Let "T1" be a theory-elaboration-sequence in U26.

Axiom (T1.A1): Let axiom A1 "Dummy axiom for demonstration purposes" be included (postulated) in T1.

Proposition (T1.P1): (r1(o1, o2) = r2(o3)). Proof: "Dummy axiom for demonstration purposes" is postulated by axiom (A1). (r1(o1, o2) = r2(o3)) is a valid formula statement interpreted from that axiom.Therefore, by the axiom-interpretation inference rule: A |- P, it follows that (r1(o1, o2) = r2(o3)). QED

Warning (warning1): By design, punctilious assures the syntactical correctness of theories, but does not perform any semantic verification. Therefore, the usage of inference-rules that interpret natural content (i.e. axiom-interpretation and definition-interpretation) is critically dependent on the correctness of the content translation performed by the theory author, from axiom or definition natural language, to formulae.

Proposition (T1.P2): (r2(o3) = r1(o1, o2)). Proof: (r1(o1, o2) = r2(o3)) follows from prop. (P1). Therefore, by the equality-commutativity inference rule: ((x1 = y1) |- (y1 = x1)), it follows that (r2(o3) = r1(o1, o2)). QED
