Let "U6" be a universe-of-discourse.

Let "T1" be a theory-elaboration-sequence in U6.

Proposition (T1.P2) - The proposition of interest: (r2(o3) ==> r1(o1, o2)). Proof: (r1(o1, o2) <==> r2(o3)), of the form (P1 <==> Q1), follows from prop. (P1). Therefore, by the biconditional-elimination-2 inference rule: ((P1 <==> Q1) |- (Q1 ==> P1)), it follows that (r2(o3) ==> r1(o1, o2)). QED
