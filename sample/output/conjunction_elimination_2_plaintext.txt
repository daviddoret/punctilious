Let "U12" be a universe-of-discourse.

Let "T1" be a theory-elaboration-sequence in U12.

Proposition (T1.P2) - The proposition of interest: r2(o3). Proof: (r1(o1, o2) and r2(o3)), of the form (P1 and Q1), follows from prop. (P1). Therefore, by the conjunction-elimination-2 inference rule: ((P1 and Q1) |- Q1), it follows that r2(o3). QED
