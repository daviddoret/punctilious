Let "U4" be a universe-of-discourse.

Let "T1" be a theory-elaboration-sequence in U4.

Proposition (T1.P2) - The proposition of interest: (r1(o1, o2) ==> r2(o3)). Proof: (r1(o1, o2) <==> r2(o3)), of the form (P1 <==> Q1), follows from prop. (P1). Therefore, by the biconditional-elimination-1 inference rule: ((P1 <==> Q1) |- (P1 ==> Q1)), it follows that (r1(o1, o2) ==> r2(o3)). QED
